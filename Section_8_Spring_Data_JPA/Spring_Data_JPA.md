# Spring_Data_JPA

## Introduction

Deep dive into Spring Data JPA
* How to map a class to a particular DB table
* How to make a DB relationship, 1:1, 1:m, m:m
* What is JPA and why we need it.
* Different annotations, native query, JPA query
* Embedded classes in entities
* Unidirection and bi-directional releationships
* Match contstraints on our entity to the DB one

JDBC
* API provided by Java
* Java objects vs DB tables 
  * How to match together?
* Ideally we are not doing conversion. We need a system.

ORM
* Object Relationship Mapping
* Define an object as a representative of the table
* Hibernate has it's own impl of ORM
* Ibatis also helps here
* JPA is just a sepecification, need to use a framework with an ORM provider (Hibernate or Ibatis)
