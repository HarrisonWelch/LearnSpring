Spring is another framework
* Gives features
  * Logging
  * Security
  * Scheduling
  * Batch processing

Spring started as small project

Spring allowes up inversion of control - give control to the framework itself
* Each and everything i

Dependency injection
* to give the independencies of another class
* We will give that to spring

Spring AOP
* Aspect Oriented Programming
